    <h1>The Truth About Cats And Dogs</h1>
    <section class="truth">
    <p>Pet ownership in the United States has more than tripled from the 1970s. It is estimated that there are now at least 164 million companion animals, primarily dogs and cats. In other words, over 62% of American households include at least one pet.</p>

     <p>Just as the U.S. has come a long way over the last few decades in terms of increased pet ownership, it's also progressed in terms of euthanasia. The number of dogs and cats euthanized each year in shelters has decreased, from 12–20 million to an estimated 3–4 million. However, there's still work to do: An estimated 2.7 million healthy shelter pets are not adopted each year, and only about 30 percent of pets in homes come from shelters or rescues.</p>

     <p>Per the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/" target="_blank">Humane Society of the United States</a>, here are a few of the many reasons to adopt rather than purchase a pet:</p>

     
     <li>If you adopt, you'll save a life. Actually two lives: the animal you adopt, plus the one there is now room for at the rescue or shelter.</li>
     <li>When you adopt, you'll get a healthy pet. Many groups spay/neuter, give medical evaluations, and temperament-test their animals.</li>
     <li>Adopting will save you money. Fees are usually considerably less than a purchase price, plus it covers initial health check-ups.</li>
     <li>Adopting a pet will make you feel better. Pets give unconditional love and have proven to improve their owners' well-being in numerous ways.</li>
     <li>If you adopt, you won't be supporting puppy mills and pet stores. Mills are nothing more than "factories" cranking out animals for profit; stores sell them for the same reason. There is little or no concern about the health and well-being of these innocent animals.</li>
